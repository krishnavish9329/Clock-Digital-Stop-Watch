# What is digital clock?
A digital clock is a type of clock that displays the time using digits, typically in the format of hours, minutes, and sometimes seconds. Unlike analog clocks, which use rotating hands to indicate time, digital clocks show time as a series of numeric values, often with a colon (:) separating hours and minutes.

# what is stopwatch?
A stopwatch is a timekeeping device used to measure the exact duration of an event, typically in seconds. Itâ€™s widely used in sports, experiments, and other activities where precise timing is essential.

# Key Features of a Digital Clock:
Time Display: The most basic digital clocks display the current time in a 24-hour or 12-hour format. <br>
AM/PM Indicator: In 12-hour format, an AM/PM indicator is used to distinguish between morning and evening times. <br>
Seconds Display: Some digital clocks also show seconds, updating every second. <br>

# Common Uses of Digital Clocks:
Home and Office: Wall-mounted or desk clocks that show the time clearly. <br>
Watches: Wearable digital watches that display time and other information. <br>
Gadgets and Devices: Many electronic devices, such as microwaves, ovens, and car dashboards, include built-in digital clocks. <br>

# Key Features of a Stopwatch:
Start/Stop Function: The primary function of a stopwatch is to start timing when an event begins and stop when it ends. <br>
Lap/Split Time: Many stopwatches allow users to record the time of intermediate segments (laps) without stopping the overall timing. <br>
Reset: A reset button clears the current timing data, allowing the stopwatch to be used again. <br>
Digital Display: Modern stopwatches often use a digital display to show the elapsed time with high precision, sometimes down to milliseconds. <br>
